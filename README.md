# Sextant

A sextant is a tool that assisted in the creation of maps. This is a utility bot that will aim to do the same, in the context of osu! 

Any message containing osu!editor timestamps will be deleted and replaced with a custom bot response that wraps the original message and links all the timestamps to integrate with osu!

Made for Discord's Hack Week 2019. Will be improved in the future.

Can be tested [here](https://discord.gg/EWPEjJD) so long as my computer is on.
